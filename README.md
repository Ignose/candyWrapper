# candywrapper

A Looping script, optimized for Halloween looping protection.

## Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```text
git checkout https://github.com/Ignose/candywrapper.git release
```


## Usage

This is intended as a "full day" wrapper, it will:
1) Run Garbo Ascend with any arguments you give it (run candyWrapper Help for more information)
2) Automatically ascend into the class of your choosing, with the astral item(s) of your choosing
3) Run the CS Script of your choosing (default is my own FolgerCS)
4) Run Garbo with any arguments you give it
5) Put on Pajamas, Nightcap, and maximize for rollover profit
6) Automatically mall-sale items if you have a script to do so (like Philter!)

On Halloween, it will default to freecandy instead of Garbo - please adjust accordingly, ensuring freecandy is installed.
